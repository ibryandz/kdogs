                        Aniuska was gentle, kind and caring towards Rory. She sent updates throughout the day, including
                        visits to the local park and we could see that Rory enjoyed her time there as she went back
                        towards Ani to say goodbye.

                        Ani is the best I could‚Äôve asked for for my very energetic dog. She was very patient with her
